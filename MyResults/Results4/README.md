Here I:
1.played with the Hyper parameters
2.Trained in gpu
3.Make epsilon 0 after 1000 episodes

I noticed: 
1.After ~200 episodes agent is able to kill all 3 zombies.
At 1000 episodes he achieves good rewards but
after that he starts to get worst.

2.Most of the time he learns to go backwards while attacking the zombies.
(Most frequently he goes in the bottom right corner)
